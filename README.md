## Usage

### Install Anaconda

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python3-dev

wget https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-2019.07-Linux-x86_64.sh

chmod +x Anaconda3-2019.07-Linux-x86_64.sh

sudo -sH

./Anaconda3-2019.07-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

anaconda3 is default to install at ```/root/anaconda3``` and then answer "yes" to allow "conda" to initialize and change the ```.bashrc``` of root.

```bash
source /root/.bashrc
```

### Update Anaconda

```bash
sudo -sH

conda update --prefix /root/anaconda3 anaconda

conda update -n base conda
```

### Install mitmproxy

```bash
sudo -sH

conda install pip

pip install mitmproxy
```

Exit to normal user by entering ```exit```

### Update mitmproxy

```bash
sudo -sH

cd /root/anaconda3

pip install mitmproxy --upgrade
```

### Install Longjing

```
sudo apt install git

git clone https://github.com/samiux/longjing

cd longjing

nano config.conf
```

where :
- ```NET_INF``` is the network interface of the mitmproxy to be listening
- ```PORT``` is port number of the mitmproxy to be listening, e.g. 8080
- ```CERT``` is the location path of the private key TLS/SSL certificate of the domain when available.  It should be starting with ```--certs```.

Please read mitmproxy "about certificate" documents for details - [Using a custom certificate](https://mitmproxy.org/docs/latest/concepts-certificates/)

```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

Finally, make sure to copy ```index.html``` to the web application root directory.

### Running

```bash
sudo systemctl restart longjing.service
```

### Limitation

- The source IP address cannot be detected or recorded.
- The speed of the web application will be slowed down a bit.
